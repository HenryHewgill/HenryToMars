    <ul>
        <li>"A warrior may retreat. He does not flee. He may lie in ambush. He does not hide. He may experience victory or defeat. He does not cease to serve."</li>
        <li>"There are things in the universe that are simply and purely evil. A warrior does not seek to understand them, or to compromise with them. He seeks only to obliterate them."</li>
        <li>"One must never dwell on failure. When defeat has come, a true warrior accepts it, learns from it, and continues on."</li>
        <li>"I can ask no more than your best. And will accept nothing less."</li>
        <li>"It is said that one should keep one’s allies within view, an one’s enemies within reach. A valid statement. One must be able to read an ally’s strengths, so as to determine how to best use them. One must similarly be able to read his enemy’s weaknesses, so as to determine how to best defeat him. But what of friends? There is no accepted answer, perhaps friendship is so exceedingly rare. But I had formulated my own. A friend need not be kept within sight or within reach. A friend must be allowed the freedom to find and follow his own path. If one is fortunate, those paths will for a time join. But if paths separate, it is comforting to know that a friend still graces the universe with his skills, and his viewpoint, and his present. For if one is remembered by a friend, one is never truly gone."</li>
        <li>"All people have regrets. Warriors are no exceptions. One would hope it was possible to distinguish between events caused by one’s carelessness or lack of ability and those caused by circumstances or forces beyond one’s control. But in practice, there is no difference. All forms of regret sear equally into the mind and soul. All forms leave scars of equal bitterness. And always, beneath the scar, lurks the thought and fear that there was something else that could have been done. Some action, or inaction, that would have changed things for the better. Such questions can sometimes be learned from. All to often, they merely add to the scar tissue. A warrior must learn to set those regrets aside as best he can. Knowing full well that they will never be far away."</li>
